Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and interests as a software development student. The portfolio not only demonstrates my technical abilities with a modern web stack but also serves as an interactive CV for potential employers, classmates, professors, and supervisors.

Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a professional, customizable portfolio that reflects my identity as a developer. It highlights my projects, background, and interests, while giving me room to apply new technologies and concepts as I continue learning.

Features

Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Multi-Page Navigation: Includes sections/pages for:

Home – Introduction and quick navigation.

About Me – Background, skills, and interests.

Projects – Showcase of personal and academic work.

Contact – Form for getting in touch.

Custom Styling: Built with CSS for a clean and modern aesthetic.

JavaScript Integration: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.

Reusable Structure: Organized codebase with models, controllers, and assets, similar to MVC-inspired structure.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

Structure: MVC-inspired with controllers and models for scalability

Assets: Images and icons for branding and UI

Deployment-ready: Can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
